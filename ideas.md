# Ideas for this project

## Initial version
* Simply init all the base folders and files with a default hardcoded template with a given project name
* Expand with multiple project templates, a projet file where settings are added etc.
* We wil have to write a parser & writer for 4coders project config file - should have a custom api so that users can write their own parsers for their editors configs. The idea is to say fuck you to traditonal build systems and add pseudo metaprogramming ability to C, so you can define your build with C itself.
## Next steps - single header repository
* Have a folder on the system path where I store all my helper libraries and other people's libraries that I regurlarly use, allow these to be auto imported by this app
* Allow this app to track updates to this repo and optionally pull in any updates when needed
* experiment with adding basic version control stuff to this project, just for educational purposes
